	    <p>It is a matter of great pleasure for me that you have chosen this splendid institute for education. It is not only a national duty but also religious obligation to get education as it has been made obligatory by Allah Almighty and the Prophet (S.A.W). In the current era, the dream to become a prosperous and developed nation cannot come true without economic, social, educational and scientific development. Besides, we will have to compete the developed nations in the field of knowledge, science and technology. The importance of education cannot be overlooked in the development of nations.
<br>
        The developed nations are ruling the world on the basis of knowledge and skill and all developing nations are their subordinates. It is impossible to count the advantages of knowledge.
<br>
        In this world of competition, educationally stable nation has great worth because it is the only weapon to resolve all issues. Government Graduate College, Civil Lines, Sheikhupura is performing its great role in providing the best and standard education to the middle class and the poor sections of society. Parents pay minor fee to enable their children to get education. Financial aid and concession in the government fee are also granted to the poor and deserving students. I hope you will take great care to uphold the dignity and sanctity of this institute after graduation. May Allah help you in days to come.</p>

	    	The college is situated behind Kanal Rest House on Sargodha Road near District Courts in Sheikhupura. This modern institute that is comprehensive and all encompassing, has been imparting education to the residents of Sheikhupura since 1959. Its journey began on 11th August 1959 as Degree College for which the government reserved 376 kanal land. However, the government merged the inter college in the degree college in 1971. After the merger, the inter college building was reserved for Govt. Girls College. A splendid building was constructed later on, on the land reserved for Govt. Degree College. The college is central in location with beautiful trees all around. The spacious building is covered with fabulous meadows and large play grounds add to its beauty. All adds to educational and literary environment which is a great advantage to the students. Besides, the laboratories are well-equipped with scientific tools and required materials. Last but not least is the presence of a spacious hostel and a masjid. The college serves the students of Sheikhupura city and its suburbs in the best possible manner. The educational standard is quite high and co-curricular activities / sports are an integral part of the academic year. There is an active sports board which works for the promotion of sports. Moreover, there are various notable societies which provide an appropriate platform for literary activities. The college is affiliated with BISE Lahore for Intermediate / HSSC and for degree classes Punjab University serves the purpose. Masters level classes began in 1998 which have been suspended for BS 4-Years Program has been launched in 10 subjects. This BS 4-Years Program is affiliated with Punjab University for which 50 seats are allotted in the beginning. Admission is purely on merit-base. The faculty renowned in the fields of science and literature is doing worth-mentioning efforts in imparting education in the respective fields. A large number of graduates of this college have been serving the nation in different departments for years.
